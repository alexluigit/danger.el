Several small extension packages to Dirvish are maintained in the subdirectory
extensions/. They are installed together with Dirvish if you pull the package
from MELPA, Dirvish can work properly with or without them though.

=dirvish-media= is the extension that handles the preview of media files (image,
video, etc.), it is enabled by default.  Apart from that, all extensions are
inactive by default and can be enabled manually if desired.

With these extensions it is possible to adapt Dirvish such that it matches your
preference or behaves similar to other familiar file explorers.

* Transient based help menu (dirvish-menu.el)

This extension provides help menu powered by =transient.el= for Dirvish.

~dirvish-dispatch~ is the prefix to invoke the top-level help menu, just like
~magit-dispatch~ as to =magit=. The menu contains most of the built-in Dired
commands and all of the Dirvish commands. Some sub-level prefix commands such as
~dirvish-mark-menu~ were created because it makes sense to group together the
Dired/Dirvish commands that serve similar purposes.

Here is a list of all prefixes provided by this extension:

+ ~dirvish-setup-menu~: change the session UI/layout/preview setup on the fly
+ ~dirvish-mark-menu~: a collection of ~dired-mark/do-*~ commands
+ ~dirvish-file-info-menu~: gather file information such as path
+ ~dirvish-chxxx-menu~: modify file attributes
+ ~dirvish-subdir-menu~: manage subdirs in the buffer
+ ~dirvish-renaming-menu~: different ways to rename files
+ ~dirvish-epa-dired-menu~: a collection of ~epa-dired-do-*~ commands

* Multi-stage copy/pasting of files (dirvish-yank.el)

Here is a quote from [[https://github.com/Fuco1/dired-hacks][dired-ranger]] that justified the ~dired-ranger-move/paste~ commands:

#+begin_quote
A feature present in most orthodox file managers is a "two-stage" copy/paste
process. Roughly, the user first selects some files, "copies" them into a
clipboard and then pastes them to the target location. This workflow is missing
in dired.

In dired, user first marks the files, then issues the dired-do-copy command
which prompts for the destination. The files are then copied there. The
dired-dwim-target option makes this a bit friendlier---if two dired windows are
opened, the other one is automatically the default target.

With the multi-stage operations, you can gather files from multiple dired
buffers into a single "clipboard", then copy or move all of them to the target
location.
#+end_quote

Multi-stage copy/paste, asynchronous I/O (whenever applicable), work with TRAMP,
=dirvish-yank= has all of them. =dirvish-yank= also handles file operations on the
same remote host, see: https://github.com/stsquad/dired-rsync/issues/24.

To copy/move/symlink/hardlink files from A to B, just mark the files in A, go to
B, and paste them with ~dirvish-yank/move/symlink/hardlink~.

* Minibuffer file preview (dirvish-peek.el)

~dirvish-peek-mode~ gives you a preview window when narrowing file candidates
using minibuffer. It displays file preview for all of the file name narrowing
commands in the same way as =dirvish= command.

*Figure 1.* A demo of ~find-library~ and ~find-file~ commands after ~dirvish-peek-mode~ enabled.

The ~dirvish-peek-display-alist~ option allows you to control the window placement
of the peek window.

~dirvish-peek-mode~ currently supports =vertico=, =selectrum=, =ivy= and =icomplete[-vertical]=.

* Version-control (git) integration (dirvish-vc.el)

This extension gives Dirvish the ablity to display version-control data in
different ways.  For now we have:

+ ~vc-state~: an attribute to display the VC state as a bitmap at left fringe
+ ~git-msg~: an attribute to display git commit messages after the file name
+ ~vc-diff~: a preview dispatcher which shows changes between the working tree and
  the index of selected files at preview window.

* Manage Dirvish's window layouts (dirvish-layout.el)

This extension provided several commands that can help with managing the window
layout of Dirvish sessions. They are:

+ ~dirvish-dwim~

  Open a session with a "smart" layout.  If current window is the only window of
  the frame, open a fullscreen session, otherwise open a single window session.

+ ~dirvish-layout-toggle~

  Toggle layout of current Dirvish session.  A session with layout means it has
  a companion preview window and possibly one or more parent windows.

+ ~dirvish-layout-switch~

  Cycle the layouts defined in ~dirvish-layout-recipes~

* Show icons at front of file name (dirvish-icons.el)

This extension provides two attributes: ~all-the-icons~ and ~vscode-icon~.  To tweak
the appearance of the icons, you have these options:

+ ~dirvish-all-the-icons-height~
+ ~dirvish-all-the-icons-offset~
+ ~dirvish-all-the-icons-palette~
+ ~dirvish-vscode-icon-size~

* Toggle Dirvish in side window (dirvish-side.el)

This extension provides the ~dirvish-side~ command. It toggles a Dirvish session
as a sidebar in the frame.

* Setup ls switches on the fly (dirvish-ls.el)

This extension provides commands to changing the ls listing switches like a
breeze. No manual editing anymore!

[[https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16313743/178141860-784e5744-a5b7-4a7b-9bdb-f0f981ca2dba.svg][https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16313743/178141860-784e5744-a5b7-4a7b-9bdb-f0f981ca2dba.svg]]

*Figure 3*. left: ~dirvish-quicksort~  right: ~dirvish-ls-switches-menu~

* Dirvish as the interface of fd (dirvish-fd.el)

This is the BEST =fd= frontend, period.

Here is a quick demo.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16313743/170814774-98cc598d-6bc5-4fc3-9eea-21c98d6d4772.mp4

Too fast? Let's break it down:

1. M-x ~dirvish-fd~, input /test/ as the search pattern and confirm
2. Oh, too many results. How about some additional filtering?
3. M-x ~dirvish-fd-switches-menu~
4. Press =f= (show file onlyï¼Œno directories)
5. Press =-e=, input "/py,yaml/", meaning search for these 2 extensions only
6. Press =-E=, input "/Emacs/", exclude the glob in the results
7. Press =RET=, refresh the results

Wait, there's more: ~dirvish-quicksort~ and ~dirvish-ls-switches-menu~ also works
for this buffer.

This extension also provides the ~dirvish-fd-jump~ command which allows you to go
to any directory in the file system using results from =fd= command as completions.

* Turn Dirvish into a tree browser (dirvish-subtree.el)

This extension gives Dirvish the ability to toggle a directory as subtree
(~dirvish-subtree-toggle~), which can be seen as a stripped-down version of
=dired-subtree=.

You can use ~dirvish-subtree-toggle~ to toggle the directory under the cursor as a
subtree.  Add ~subtree-state~ to ~dirvish-attributes~ gives you an indicator about
whether the directory is expanded or not.

* History navigation commands (dirvish-history.el)

|-----------------------------+---------------------------------------|
| Command                     | Description                           |
|-----------------------------+---------------------------------------|
| ~dirvish-history-jump~        | Go to recently visited directories    |
| ~dirvish-history-go-forward~  | Go forward history (session locally)  |
| ~dirvish-history-go-backward~ | Go backward history (session locally) |
| ~dirvish-history-last~        | Go to most recent used Dirvish buffer |
|-----------------------------+---------------------------------------|

* Bookmarks (dirvish-bookmark.el)

This extension gives you the ability of jumping to anywhere in the filesystem
with minimal (2 usually) keystrokes.  Just define the bookmarks in
~dirvish-bookmark-entries~ and access them by calling ~dirvish-bookmark-jump~.

* Collapse unique nested paths (dirvish-collapse.el)

This extension provides the ~collapse~ attribute.

#+begin_quote
Often times we find ourselves in a situation where a single file or directory is
nested in a chain of nested directories with no other content. This is sometimes
due to various mandatory layouts demanded by packaging tools or tools generating
these deeply-nested "unique" paths to disambiguate architectures or versions
(but we often use only one anyway). If the user wants to access these
directories they have to quite needlessly drill-down through varying number of
"uninteresting" directories to get to the content.

                                                   -- from [[https://github.com/Fuco1/dired-hacks][dired-collapse]]
#+end_quote

* Live-narrowing of Dirvish buffer (dirvish-narrow.el)

This package provides live filtering of files in dirvish buffers.  In general,
after calling ~dirvish-narrow~ you type a filter string into the minibuffer.
After each change the changes automatically reflect in the buffer. Typing =RET=
will exit the live filtering mode and leave the dired buffer in the narrowed
state.  Typing =C-g= will cancel the narrowing and restore the original view.  To
bring it back to the original view after the narrowing, just call ~revert-buffer~
(usually bound to =g=).

After invoking the ~dirvish-narrow~ command, the user input in the minibuffer is
converted to regexps by a compiler function.  You can customize the
~dirvish-narrow-regex-builder~ option to specify this function.  For example, set
this option to ~orderless-pattern-compiler~ enables orderless style pattern
matching while narrowing the Dirvish buffer.

* Pin files you are interested in at top (dirvish-emerge.el)

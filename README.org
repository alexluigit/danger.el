* Introduction

Dirvish is an improved version of the Emacs inbuilt package [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][Dired]].  It not only
gives Dired an appealing and highly customizable user interface, but also comes
together with almost all possible parts required for full usability as a modern
file manager.

#+begin_quote
The experience of dirvish is surreal and even bizarre after all these years of
trying to use dired. Like how professionals make their craft look easy, dirvish
does something similar with how it builds on dired. Dirvish is paradoxical in
that it provides a completely different experience while still fundamentally
being dired at its core.

* Installation

Dirvish is available on [[https://melpa.org][Melpa]], you can install it directly via ~package-install~
if you have melpa in your ~package-archives~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package dirvish
  :ensure t
  :init
  ;; Let Dirvish take over Dired globally
  (dirvish-override-dired-mode))
#+end_src

* Quickstart

+ =M-x= ~dirvish~ gives you a 3-pane (parent+current+preview) session
+ =M-x= ~dired~ | ~dired-jump~ | ... gives you a "dirvish-ish" Dired buffer/session
+ =M-x= ~dirvish-toggle-fullscreen~ enters/exits fullscreen of the current session
+ =M-x= ~dirvish-dispatch~ will briefly tell you what Dirvish has to offer

Now enjoy your brand-new Dired, or if you will, call it Dirvish üê±.

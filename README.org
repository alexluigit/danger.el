* Introduction

#+begin_quote
The experience of dirvish is surreal and even bizarre after all these years of
trying to use dired. Like how professionals make their craft look easy, dirvish
does something similar with how it builds on dired. Dirvish is paradoxical in
that it provides a completely different experience while still fundamentally
being dired at its core.

Dirvish is an improved version of the Emacs inbuilt package [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][Dired]].  It not only
gives Dired an appealing and highly customizable user interface, but also comes
together with almost all possible parts required for full usability as a modern
file manager.

* Installation

Dirvish is available on [[https://melpa.org/#/dirvish][Melpa]].  Just type =M-x package-install RET dirvish RET=
into Emacs 27.1+.  =el-get= users can get the recipe from [[https://github.com/alexluigit/dirvish/issues/90][here]].

It is highly recommended to install these dependencies to get the best preview experience:

- *macOS*

  ~brew install coreutils poppler ffmpegthumbnailer mediainfo imagemagick gnu-tar unzip~

- *Debian*

  ~apt-get install poppler-utils ffmpegthumbnailer mediainfo imagemagick tar unzip~

- *Arch*

  ~pacman -S poppler ffmpegthumbnailer mediainfo imagemagick tar unzip~

- ... (help us to improving the list)

You may also want to check out the *File preview* section in [[file:CUSTOMIZING.org][Customizing.org]].

* Quickstart

After installation, let Dirvish take over Dired globally:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(dirvish-override-dired-mode)
#+end_src

+ =M-x= ~dirvish~ gives you a 3-pane (parent+current+preview) session
+ =M-x= ~dired~ | ~dired-jump~ | ... gives you a "dirvish-ish" Dired buffer/session
+ Press =?= in a dirvish buffer to see the list of available commands

Now enjoy your brand-new Dired, or if you will, call it Dirvish üê±.

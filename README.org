#+html: <p align="center"><i>A minimalistic yet versatile file manager based on</i> <b>Dired</b></p>

* Introduction

This package gives Dired the following features:

+ Multiple window layouts
+ Always available file preview
+ Isolated sessions
+ A modern and composable user interface

... to name a few.

#+begin_quote
The experience of dirvish is surreal and even bizarre after all these years of
trying to use dired. Like how professionals make their craft look easy, dirvish
does something similar with how it builds on dired. Dirvish is paradoxical in
that it provides a completely different experience while still fundamentally
being dired at its core.

+ =M-x= ~dirvish-toggle-fullscreen~ enters/exits fullscreen of the current session
